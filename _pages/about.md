Jube is an open-source software for real-time transaction and event monitoring, using AI and decision-making to prevent
fraud and detect abuse. It emphasizes AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance, aligning with
the [Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf) to meet
regulatory standards based on FATF guidelines and the Wolfsberg Principles. While AML is
the primary focus, Jube’s real-time system and methodologies also support broader transaction monitoring use cases, with
slight adaptations for different scenarios.

Jube's philosophy is rooted in empowering technology teams by ensuring complete autonomy and eliminating any residual
external dependencies. By steadfastly adhering to the open-source promise, Jube provides tools that are genuinely
open-source, licensed under the AGPLv3, with no pay-gated features or hidden vendor lock-in tactics. This commitment to
transparency and freedom allows teams to fully own and control their technology stack, fostering innovation and
resilience.
