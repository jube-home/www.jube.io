**Company Introduction**
JOL is a UK company that architects, develops, and implements horizontally scalable, high-throughput software for real-time transaction and event monitoring. Engagements with Clients typically span software development, data engineering, machine learning (both supervised and unsupervised classification), and increasingly artificial intelligence, including integration, embedding, and inference where distinct from machine learning.

JOL’s stated mission is to work with Clients on the training, support, and implementation of Jube – an Open-Source Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") and Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring software, which it maintains. Under the umbrella of JOL, there is also a corpus of advanced analytics know-how.

**1. Scope of Services**
1.1 These Terms of Business govern the provision of support services and/or software development services (“Services”) by JOL (“Provider”) to the client (“Client”).
1.2 Any proposal, statement of work, quotation, or similar document agreed between the parties shall be deemed incorporated into these Terms.
1.3 The Provider reserves the right to modify these Terms of Business from time to time. The applicable version of the Terms of Business shall be included in each Work Order and shall take effect upon the Client’s acceptance of that Work Order.

---

**2. Fees and Payment**
2.1 Fees for the Services will be as set out in the applicable agreement, quotation, or statement of work.
2.2 All fees are exclusive of taxes, which shall be payable by the Client in addition.
2.3 Fees shall be invoiced and payable monthly in advance (covering a one-month period), or as otherwise agreed in the statement of work.
2.4 Payment is due within thirty (30) days of the date of the Provider’s invoice.
2.5 If any payment is not made when due, the Provider reserves the right to charge statutory interest at the rate applicable under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, accruing daily until payment is received in full.
2.6 To the extent that on-site visits to the Client’s premises (or any other location) are required, the Provider shall be entitled to charge for reasonable travel and subsistence expenses. Such expenses will be billed in accordance with the HMRC international scale rate directory (as updated from time to time – see https://www.gov.uk/guidance/expenses-rates-for-employees-travelling-outside-the-uk) and must be agreed with the Client in advance.
