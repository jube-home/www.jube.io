**Company Introduction**
JOL is a UK company that architects, develops, and implements horizontally scalable, high-throughput software for real-time transaction and event monitoring. Engagements with clients typically span software development, data engineering, machine learning (both supervised and unsupervised classification), and increasingly artificial intelligence, including integration, embedding, and inference where distinct from machine learning.

JOL’s stated mission is to work with clients on the training, support, and implementation of Jube – an Open-Source Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring software, which it maintains. Under the umbrella of JOL, there is also a corpus of advanced analytics know-how.
