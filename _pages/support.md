Support is a compelling value proposition for organizations implementing and managing the Jube software, particularly in
the specialized domain of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance, aligning with the Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance to meet
regulatory standards based on FATF guidelines and the Wolfsberg Principles. While AML is the primary focus, Jube’s
real-time system and methodologies also support broader transaction monitoring use cases, with slight adaptations for
different scenarios.

Here's a breakdown of its key benefits and features of support:

## **Key Benefits of Support:**

1. **Expert Support:**
    - Direct access to the Jube developers ensures that users receive guidance from those who know the software best.
    - This expertise can significantly reduce implementation time, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and optimize system
      performance.

2. **Efficiency and Assurance:**
    - Quarterly fully tested releases ensure predictable software performance across all updates.
    - Timely bug resolution, update implementation support, and infrastructure optimization guidance keep systems
      running smoothly and securely.
    - Minimized downtime and maximized productivity through rigorous quality control and continuous maintenance.

3. **Strategic Influence:**
    - Subscribers gain influence over the product roadmap, allowing them to shape future features and improvements based
      on their specific needs.

4. **Cost-Effective:**
    - At $480/month for four hours of retained support, a 24-hour service level, and only a rolling three-month
      commitment, Jube provides a cost-effective alternative to building and maintaining an in-house team with
      equivalent expertise.

## **Features of Support:**

- **Direct Developer Access:**
    - Email and chat support for documented features ensures quick resolution of issues.
    - Zoom support for more complex or hands-on troubleshooting.

- **Private-Fork Development & Tested Releases:**

      stability before deployment.
    - Prior to release, all changes undergo comprehensive regression testing and quality assurance checks to ensure
      consistent reliability and performance.

## **Why Choose Support Over Self-Implementation?**

While Jube is open-source and can be implemented independently, Support offers several advantages:

valuable investment for businesses in the fraud and abuse detection domain.
