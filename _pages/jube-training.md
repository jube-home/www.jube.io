# **Training Plan**

It is common to implement and run Jube based on the time spent with the <a href="https://jube-home.github.io/jube/">
documentation</a> alone. Training provides a significant acceleration of a successful implementation of Jube. The
training is delivered in person by the [developer](https://www.churchman.io) of Jube.

While transaction monitoring encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, this training specifically focuses on
the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring use cases. The training is designed to
support compliance efforts and is structured around this guidance.

It is important to note that Jube operates as a real-time system. As a result, while the training emphasizes
implementation of this guidance other transaction monitoring use cases will also be comprehensively addressed by
implication. The underlying concepts are largely adjacent and require similar methodologies, albeit with subtle
differences in application.

The following is an abridged version of the
full [Jube Training Plan (pdf)](https://jube.io/JubeTrainingPlan.pdf).

The training spans **3 to 4 days**, with each day lasting **6 to 8 hours**, depending on elective modules.
Elective
modules provide in-depth training on advanced administrative concepts using dedicated servers. These are ideal
for technical participants responsible for system administration but do not require developer expertise.

For organizations with developer teams, an **additional day** is available to familiarize them with the Jube codebase
for business continuity. This session covers software patterns, frameworks, coding standards, and hands-on debugging.

ask questions and obtain
guidance after
the training delivery. The developer of Jube will provide timely, asynchronous responses to ensure the
participants can confidently apply what they‚Äôve learned and resolve any challenges that arise.
