# Why Jube Training and Implementation?

💡 **Training Direct from the Developer**  
Learn Jube straight from its creator—no second-hand knowledge, no gaps.

⚡ **Rapid Mastery**  
Get proficient in days, not months. Accelerate your implementation timeline.

🔓 **True Independence**  
Own your AML and transaction monitoring stack—free from vendor lock-in and restrictive contracts.

📈 **Smart ROI**  
Faster evaluation, smoother implementation, fewer mistakes, and independent mastery mean your training investment
multiplies in value.

🤝 **Real Implementation Outcome**
Hands-on training plus up to six weeks of pilot implementation support ensures your team can deploy Jube, configure
rules, manage cases, and validate alerts—turning learning into a fully operational pre-production system.

🛠 **Fully Open-Source & Transparent**  
[Jube is fully open-source (AGPLv3)](https://github.com/jube-home/aml-fraud-transaction-monitoring) with all features
available and no vendor lock-in. It is transparent, auditable, and extensible—keeping your data under your control while
enabling rapid adaptation to new products, workflows, regulations, or payment schemes.

Break free from overpriced, restrictive AML and fraud detection systems. Learn Jube and take full control of your
technology stack.

    - Navigate the user interface and integrate via APIs (e.g., Postman).
    - Configure rule strategies: Gateway, Abstraction, Activation Rules for abuse detection.
    -
        - Be equipped to move directly into a pilot implementation period.

- **Optimize Performance & Security:**
    - Configure caching, sanctions screening, and suppression techniques (key/total/rule-based).
    - Use TTL counters for high-volume transaction tracking.

- **Accelerate Adoption & Best Practices:**
    - Build and evaluate predictive models for fraud and credit risk.
    - Implement machine learning via exhaustive training.
    - Design case management workflows (tracking, forms, audits).

- **Troubleshoot & Debug (for Developers):**
    - Explore Jube architecture (Docker, Redis, Postgres).
    - Debug with INFO-level logs and manage asynchronous processes (AMQP) and background threads.

- **Leverage Advanced Compliance Features:**
    - Apply fuzzy matching (Levenshtein) for sanctions.
    - Trigger real-time alerts/cases via Activation Rules.
    - Create custom dashboards for oversight.

# **Implementation Outcomes**

After completing the training, participants will enter a pilot implementation period of up to **six weeks**, gaining
hands-on experience running Jube in a real-world environment. Typical outcomes include:

- **Single Channel Deployment:** Configure and activate a core transaction monitoring channel connected to sandbox or
  live data sources, ready to process real transactions.
- **Initial Rules Configuration:** Define, test, and deploy a foundational set of AML and fraud detection rules,
  including gateway, abstraction, and activation rules aligned with your workflows.
- **Case Management Setup:** Implement basic case management workflows to track alerts, investigations, and resolutions.
  Learn to assign cases, monitor progress, and generate compliance-ready reports.
- **Monitoring & Adjustment:** Observe system behavior, analyze analytics and logs, identify false positives or gaps,
  and refine rules and workflows accordingly.
- **Operational Readiness:** In keeing
  with [Transaction Monitoring Compliance Methodology](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf) create
  processes and best practices for real-time monitoring, escalation, and compliance
  reporting, ensuring your team can confidently operate independently.
- **Pilot Validation:** Complete the pilot cycle within the six-week period, demonstrating that alerts are
  captured and managed correctly, and providing actionable insights for scaling to additional channels and rules.

This approach ensures training is **practical, not just theoretical**—participants transition seamlessly into a **live
pilot**, leaving with both knowledge and a working implementation ready for expansion.

## Service Delivery

Throughout the pilot, partners receive flexible, on-demand guidance to support successful integration, including:

- **Matrix Chat Room:** Asynchronous access to the developer for timely guidance.
- **Email Support:** Clarifications and implementation advice.
- **On-Demand Meetings:** Live walkthroughs and problem-solving sessions as needed.

Partners can also optionally engage Jube on an **Expert of Record** basis. This is not billed developer time, but a
strategic assurance layer: a lightweight monthly retainer providing priority access to senior expertise, architectural
oversight, and escalation support. Your team retains control of day-to-day development, while Jube offers guidance on
critical issues—reducing risk, avoiding costly mistakes, and ensuring high-quality delivery. Any deeper, hands-on
intervention is scoped and billed separately.

# **Training Plan**

It is common to implement and run Jube based on the time spent with the <a href="https://jube-home.github.io/jube/">
documentation</a> alone. Training provides a significant acceleration of a successful implementation of Jube. The
training is delivered by [Richard Churchman](https://www.churchman.io), the developer of Jube.

While transaction monitoring encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, this training specifically focuses on
the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring use cases. The training is designed to
support compliance efforts and is structured around this guidance.

It is important to note that Jube operates as a real-time system. As a result, while the training emphasizes
implementation of this guidance other transaction monitoring use cases will also be comprehensively addressed by
implication. The underlying concepts are largely adjacent and require similar methodologies, albeit with subtle
differences in application.

The training spans **3 to 4 days**, with each day lasting **6 to 8 hours**, depending on elective modules.
Elective
modules provide in-depth training on advanced administrative concepts using dedicated servers. These are ideal
for technical participants responsible for system administration but do not require developer expertise.

For organizations with developer teams, an **additional two days** is available to familiarize them with the Jube
codebase
for business continuity. This session covers software patterns, frameworks, coding standards, and hands-on debugging.
