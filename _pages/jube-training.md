While transaction monitoring encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, this remote training specifically focuses on
the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) use case. The remote training is designed to support compliance efforts and is
structured around this guidance. This guidance is intended to be adapted by compliance managers to align with an
organization’s specific regulatory obligations, which are often derived from Financial Action Taskforce (FATF)
guidelines and further reflected in the Wolfsberg Principles.

It is important to note that Jube operates as a real-time system. As a result, while the remote training emphasizes
implementation of this guidance other transaction monitoring use cases will also be comprehensively addressed by
implication. The underlying concepts are largely adjacent and require similar methodologies, albeit with subtle
differences in application.

## **Program Outcomes:**

* Confidently Implement and Manage Jube: Master Jube’s AML transaction monitoring (FATF/Wolfsberg-aligned), UI navigation, API integration (e.g., Postman), and rule strategies (Gateway/Abstraction/Activation Rules) for fraud/AML detection.
* Optimize Jube for Performance & Security: Configure caching, sanctions screening, and suppression techniques (keys/total/rule-based); use TTL counters for high-volume transaction tracking.
* Accelerate Adoption with Best Practices: Build/evaluate predictive models (fraud/credit risk); implement ML via Exhaustive training; design case management workflows (tracking, forms, audits).
* Troubleshoot & Debug (Developers): Explore Jube’s architecture (Docker/Redis/Postgres), debug with INFO-level logs, and manage async processes (AMQP) and background threads.
* Leverage Advanced Compliance Features: Apply fuzzy matching (Levenshtein) for sanctions, trigger real-time alerts/cases via Activation Rules, and create custom dashboards for oversight.

## **Training Plan**:

The following is an abridged version of the
full [Jube Remote Training Plan (pdf)](https://jube.io/JubeTrainingPlan.pdf).

The remote training spans **3 to 4 days**, with each day lasting **6 to 8 hours**, depending on elective modules.
Elective
modules provide in-depth remote training on advanced administrative concepts using dedicated servers. These are ideal
for technical participants responsible for system administration but do not require developer expertise.

For organizations with developer teams, an **additional day** is available to familiarize them with the Jube codebase
for business continuity. This session covers software patterns, frameworks, coding standards, and hands-on debugging.

### **Day 1: Configuring Models, Messaging and Rule Strategy:**

- AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance Overview
- Introduction to Jube and Key User Interface Concepts
- Models and HTTP Messaging
- Request XPath Payload
- Inline Functions
- Gateway Rules
- Abstraction Rules
- Abstraction Calculations
- Activation Rules
- Lists and Dictionaries
- Workshop
- **Elective**: Architecture and Caching, Environment Variables, Installation, and Log Configuration

### **Day 2: Suppressions, Sanctions, Machine Learning and Case Workflow:**

- Suppression
- Sanctions Fuzzy Matching
- Time To Live (TTL) Counters
- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Exhaustive Machine Learning Training
- Activation Watcher
- Tags
- Case Workflows
- Workshop
- **Elective**: Tracing Transaction Flow, High Availability, Performance Counters, AMQP

### **Day 3: Permissions, Database, Reporting, Reprocessing and Extensibility:**

- Users, Roles, and Permissions:
- SQL Database Discovery
- Visualization and Reporting
- Reprocessing
- Inline Scripts and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
- Scores via Synchronous RPC
- Synchronous Messaging and Advanced Data Engineering
- Workshop
- **Elective**: Tracing Transaction Flow, Bottleneck Analysis, and Cache Training

### **Day 4 (Optional): Developer Workshop:**

- Software Patterns
- C# Solution and Project Overview
- Building and Running
- Stepping and Debugging .NET Hosting, Dependency Injection, and Migrations
- Stepping and Debugging the User Interface (Frontend and Backend):

## **Conclusion:**

In conclusion, Jube’s comprehensive remote training program is designed to empower professionals with the knowledge and
skills
necessary to effectively implement, manage, and optimize Jube within their organizations. By offering a blend of core
concepts, advanced features, and elective modules, the program ensures participants gain hands-on experience and
practical insights tailored to their roles—whether they are developers, compliance officers, fraud prevention
specialists, or system administrators.

The structured agenda, spanning 3 to 4 days, provides a deep dive into Jube’s capabilities, from AI-driven solutions and
sanctions fuzzy matching to performance optimization and debugging. With optional developer remote training,
organizations can
also ensure their technical teams are well-equipped to maintain and troubleshoot the system for long-term business
continuity.

By attending this program, participants will not only accelerate the adoption of Jube but also facilitate their ability
to leverage its advanced features for fraud detection, compliance, and financial crime prevention. Ultimately, this
remote training equips organizations to maximize the value of Jube, ensuring scalability, security, and operational
efficiency
in an ever-evolving landscape.

For those ready to take the next step, Jube’s remote training program is an invaluable investment in building expertise
and
driving successful implementation.
