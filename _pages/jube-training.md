## **Public Training – Kuala Lumpur | April 2026**

A small, in-person cohort for teams implementing Jube in production environments.

**Dates:** **Tuesday 14 – Thursday 16 April 2026**  
**Location:** **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia** (Hosted at a 4-star business hotel conference facility — final venue confirmed once minimum cohort size is met)  
**Format:** 3 full days, hands-on, instructor-led  
**Cohort size:** **Maximum 8 participants** (minimum 4 to run)  
**Price:** **USD 1,625 per participant**  
*Includes all training materials, hands-on workshops, lunch, and refreshments each day, plus up to six weeks remote pilot support*

This is a **serious, implementation-focused course** delivered by the developer of Jube. It is designed for compliance leaders, architects, engineers, and analysts who need to **deploy and operate Jube with confidence**, not just evaluate it.

The format is deliberately small to allow:
- Deep technical discussion
- Hands-on configuration and workshops
- Real implementation questions
- Direct access to the developer
