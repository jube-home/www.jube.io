# Who is Jube for?

- **Compliance & Risk Leaders:** Get a holistic view of compliance and fraud risk. Quickly generate reports for auditors
  and regulators to stay ahead of evolving requirements.
- **Fraud Analysts:** Move from insight to action faster. Build, test, and refine detection rules to proactively reduce
  fraud losses.
- **Data Analysts & Scientists:** Go beyond basic rules with advanced analytics and machine learning to uncover hidden
  patterns and improve detection accuracy.
- **Developers & Technical Teams:** Integrate Jube seamlessly with clear APIs and developer-friendly tools for fast,
  reliable implementation.

# **Learning Outcomes**

- **Implement & Manage Jube Confidently:**
    - Master AML (FATF/Wolfsberg) and Fraud Detection transaction monitoring.
    - Navigate the user interface and integrate via APIs (e.g., Postman).
    - Configure rule strategies: Gateway, Abstraction, Activation Rules for abuse detection.

- **Optimize Performance & Security:**
    - Configure caching, sanctions screening, and suppression techniques (key/total/rule-based).
    - Use TTL counters for high-volume transaction tracking.

- **Accelerate Adoption & Best Practices:**
    - Build and evaluate predictive models for fraud and credit risk.
    - Implement machine learning via exhaustive training.
    - Design case management workflows (tracking, forms, audits).

- **Troubleshoot & Debug (for Developers):**
    - Explore Jube architecture (Docker, Redis, Postgres).
    - Debug with INFO-level logs and manage asynchronous processes (AMQP) and background threads.

- **Leverage Advanced Compliance Features:**
    - Apply fuzzy matching (Levenshtein) for sanctions.
    - Trigger real-time alerts/cases via Activation Rules.
    - Create custom dashboards for oversight.

* **User Training**: Provides a comprehensive understanding of all Jube functionality, enabling staff to effectively
  operate and leverage the platform for day-to-day business processes.
* **Developer Training**: Offers in-depth technical instruction on the Jube codebase, ensuring teams have the expertise
  required to maintain, extend, and support the platform for ongoing business continuity.

# **Training Plan Overview**

It is common to implement and run Jube based on the time spent with the <a href="https://jube-home.github.io/jube/">
documentation</a> alone. Training provides a significant acceleration of a successful implementation of Jube. The
training is delivered in person by the [developer](https://www.churchman.io) of Jube.

While transaction monitoring encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, this training specifically focuses on
the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring use cases. The training is designed to
support compliance efforts and is structured around this guidance.

It is important to note that Jube operates as a real-time system. As a result, while the training emphasizes
implementation of this guidance other transaction monitoring use cases will also be comprehensively addressed by
implication. The underlying concepts are largely adjacent and require similar methodologies, albeit with subtle
differences in application.

The training spans **3 to 4 days**, with each day lasting **6 to 8 hours**, depending on elective modules.
Elective
modules provide in-depth training on advanced administrative concepts using dedicated servers. These are ideal
for technical participants responsible for system administration but do not require developer expertise.

For organizations with developer teams, an **additional two days** is available to familiarize them with the Jube
codebase
for business continuity. This session covers software patterns, frameworks, coding standards, and hands-on debugging.
