## **Public Training – Kuala Lumpur | April 2026**

A small, in-person cohort for teams implementing Jube in production environments.

**Dates:** **Tuesday 14 – Thursday 16 April 2026**  
**Location:** **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia** (4-star business hotel conference facilities – final venue confirmed once minimum cohort reached)  
**Format:** 3 full days, hands-on, instructor-led  
**Cohort size:** **Maximum 8 participants** (minimum 4 to run)  
**Price:** **USD 1,625 per participant**

This is a **serious, implementation-focused course** delivered by the developer of Jube. It is designed for compliance leaders, architects, engineers, and analysts who need to **deploy and operate Jube with confidence**, not just evaluate it.

The format is deliberately small to allow:
- deep technical discussion
- hands-on configuration and workshops
- real implementation questions
- direct access to the developer

For organisations with larger teams, specialized use cases, or internal training requirements, Jube also offers **private training**, delivered remotely or on-site.

- Fully customizable to your team’s schedule and focus areas
- Can include **developer workshops**, advanced topics, and pilot implementation support
- Pricing depends on scope and number of participants (starting at **USD 3,000 per day**)

> Private training is ideal for organisations needing tailored coverage or multiple team streams. Public training is recommended for individuals or smaller teams looking for cost-effective, structured, hands-on learning.
