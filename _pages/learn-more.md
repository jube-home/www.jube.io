While transaction monitoring covers a wide range of activities, Jube specifically targets the Anti-Money Laundering (
AML) and Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring use cases. To enhance clarity and precision,
the [Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance (pdf)](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf) has been
developed and is
meticulously maintained. Guidance is designed to assist compliance managers in tailoring it to meet their
organizationâ€™s unique regulatory requirements. These obligations are often rooted in the Financial Action Task Force (
FATF) guidelines and further reflected in the Wolfsberg Principles, which are updated periodically to reflect evolving
standards.

The [Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance (pdf)](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf) document
provides a comprehensive framework for

## Core Principles of AML and Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring

- **Know Your Customer (KYC):** Central to AML compliance, involving due diligence and ongoing monitoring.
- **Risk-Based Approach (RBA):** Financial institutions assess risks and implement proportionate controls.
- **Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** Five levels of diligence, from anonymous to enhanced monitoring and suspicious
  activity reporting (SAR).
- **Fraud Detection*** Overlap with Fraud Detection Transaction Monitoring use cases.

## Automated Monitoring Systems

- **Real-Time and Batch Processing:** Jube supports both real-time and batch processing for transaction monitoring.
- **Anomaly Detection and Classification:** Utilizes supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.
- **Activation Rules:** Escalate suspicious cases for further investigation.

## Data-Driven Risk-Based Approach

- **Risk Factors:** Includes product characteristics, transaction behaviour, and geographic spending patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Such as One-Class SVM to identify anomalies and classify suspicious activities.
- **Abstraction Rules:** Model risk factors and integrate them into activation rules for case escalation.

## Case Management

- **Case Review:** Flagged cases are reviewed by analysts with statuses like "Refer to MLRO," "No Further Action," or "
  SAR Sent."
- **Audit Trails:** Ensure transparency, and EDD documentation can be uploaded for further investigation.
- **Escalation:** Streamlined escalation to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) and SAR creation.

## MLRO Dashboards

- **Real-Time Insights:** Provide insights into product behaviour, customer activity, and territorial risks.
- **Proactive Risk Management:** Enable adaptation to emerging threats.

## Integration and Data Processing

- **Data Sources:** Integrates data from various sources such as MasterCard/Visa authorizations, financial transactions,
  and CDD events.
- **IP Address Decoding:** Provides geographic and contextual insights for risk assessment.
- **Serial Processing:** Data is processed serially, even in batch mode, to simulate real-time monitoring.

## Value Proposition

- **Cost Reduction:** Eliminates prohibitive costs of proprietary solutions.
- **Vendor Lock-In Eradication:** Open-source nature ensures flexibility.
- **Improved Compliance:** Advanced tooling enhances regulatory adherence.
