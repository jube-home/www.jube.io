For self-guided learning, users can explore the [documentation](https://jube-home.github.io/jube/), interact with Jooby
or Jube’s AI-powered chatbot.

To accelerate implementation, **Richard Churchman**, the developer of Jube, offers a comprehensive training program. This program is designed to equip participants with the skills needed to confidently implement, manage, and optimize Jube for their specific requirements.

While transaction monitoring encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, this training specifically focuses on the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) use case. The training is designed to support compliance efforts and is structured around the
[Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance (pdf)](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf).
This guidance is intended to be adapted by compliance managers to align
with an organization’s specific regulatory obligations, which are often derived from Financial Action Taskforce (FATF)
guidelines and further reflected in the Wolfsberg Principles.

It is important to note that Jube operates as a real-time system. As a result, while the training emphasizes
implementation of
the [Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance (pdf)](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf),
other transaction monitoring use cases will also be comprehensively addressed by implication. The underlying concepts
are
largely adjacent and require similar methodologies, albeit with subtle differences in application.
