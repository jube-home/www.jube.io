To further support users, Jube offers a comprehensive training program designed to equip participants with the skills
needed to confidently implement, manage, and optimize Jube.

While transaction monitoring encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, this training specifically focuses on the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) use case. The training is designed to support compliance efforts and is structured around the
[Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf).
This guidance is intended to be adapted by compliance managers to align
with your organization’s specific regulatory obligations, which are often derived from Financial Action Taskforce (FATF)
guidelines and further reflected in the Wolfsberg Principles.

It is important to note that Jube operates as a real-time system. As a result, while the training emphasizes
implementation of
the [Jube AML Monitoring Compliance Guidance](https://jube.io/JubeAMLMonitoringComplianceGuidance.pdf),
other transaction monitoring use cases will also be comprehensively addressed by implication. The underlying concepts
are
largely adjacent and require similar methodologies, albeit with subtle differences in application.
