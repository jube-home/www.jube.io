It is perfectly possible to implement and run Jube based on the time spent with
the <a href="https://jube-home.github.io/jube/">documentation</a> alone. Still, in opting for Support, outcomes are
achieved much faster, with fewer resources, expertly delivered and assured.

## Public Release User Profile and Training

Users of the public release of Jube typically take two forms:

* Large entities or corporations that have access to a pool of developers and infrastructure resources who can
  understand
  the source code and the arrangement of containerised, highly available distributed systems. Such clients tend to
  require
  minimal support and, given the open-source nature of Jube, more robust business continuity than can be achieved with
  proprietary software.
* Small entities and startups that require reliable and responsive support on a small budget, yet are wholly underserved
  by proprietary vendors.

Jube offers training to accelerate the use of the public release, but it tends only to be appropriate where the client
profile is unlikely to require ongoing support.

## Trusted Partner Support Agreements

For Jube users who require more support and assurance, Support is available via Trusted Partners.

Trusted Partners take on responsibility for:

* Being accredited by Jube which involves core training, developer training and advanced analytics training
  culminating in the creation of a highly distributed, and highly available, real-time implementation of Jube.
* The maintenance of a private fork of Jube having been reviewed by their own team of developers. There is always a line
  by line review of the code \ stepping by the partner. The partner knows exactly what code is there, and in some cases.
  remove things not in use.
* The implementation of Trusted Partners own code review processes and other customary software development practices
  ensure
  Jube
* Certain additional features, by agreement, are often added which are relevant to the Trusted Partners use case, but
  these need
  not be shared by the partner.
* The execution of the Trusted Partners own security scanners such and additional compliance assurance.
  remains in a secure state, and no code gets in that has not been developed or merged by the partner.
* Selectivity exists over which new features are merged in from the public branch.
* The hosting of the Jube inside the Trusted Partners private network with various other risk management measures, such
  as
  Web Application Firewall and Intrusion Detection. Alternatively, the deployment of Jube inside custom hardened Docker
  containers.
* Helpdesk, front line support and service level agreement
* Own Trusted Partner branding of Jube by agreement.

The net result is a product that has similar characteristics to something developed in-house by the partner, albeit with
a significant
degree of acceleration, and enormous cost reduction.

A trusted partner introduction is available; alternatively, Jube is open to working with Trusted Partners on an
introduction, and on the above basis.
