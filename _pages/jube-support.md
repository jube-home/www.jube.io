Support provides direct retained access to the developer to facilitate the implementation, maintenance and ongoing
production running of Jube. It is perfectly possible to implement and run Jube based on the time spent with the
documentation alone. Still, in opting for Support, outcomes are achieved much faster, with fewer resources, and are
assured to be ongoing.

## Support Outcomes

* All Jube features are open-source, and always will be. New code is first committed to the public master branch, but in
  practice public master is analogous to a develop branch, and releases are not tagged. Support provides access to a
  private fork with comprehensive - client implementation specific - test coverage, to assured release tags.
  Notwithstanding releases being sourced from a private fork, all the software is still licensed under AGPLv3, as public
  master branch, and source code is otherwise the same.
* Direct communication channels (email, chat, and scheduled meetings) for swift issue resolution and hands-on
  implementation assistance.
* Access to Support Wiki, including private client implementation specific resources such as infrastructure
  documentation, configuration environment and production support procedures.
* Prioritised bug fixes and infrastructure recommendations to maintain high availability and optimal system performance.
* Expert consultation to enhance fraud and abuse detection strategies using Jubeâ€™s analytics capabilities.
* The retained nature is such that a rich understanding of client infrastructure and domain is brought to bear in the
  execution of the Support.

## Pricing

* Support is EUR 800 a month with only a three-month rolling commitment.
* Custom development is, to the extent it is needed (and it usually isn't), EUR 100 per hour. However, the scope of
  engagement, and therefore project cost, is typically agreed in advance.

## Partners

Jube users typically take two forms:
Large entities or corporations that have access to a pool of developers and infrastructure resources who can understand
the source code and the arrangement of containerised, highly available distributed systems. Such clients tend to require
minimal support and, given the open-source nature of Jube, more robust business continuity than can be achieved with
proprietary software.
Small entities and startups that require reliable and responsive support on a small budget, yet are wholly underserved
by proprietary vendors.
It is a common situation that Support from Jube is made available under the umbrella of a System Integrator or
Consulting Firm, which Jube has either certified directly or is otherwise introduced to Jube based on a longstanding and
trusted working relationship with the user (to the effect of achieving the outcome of our large entity or corporation
users).
