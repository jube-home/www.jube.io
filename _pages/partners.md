## Partner‑First Engagement Model

**Jube operates on a partner‑first model.** The preferred and primary engagement approach is through trained
implementation partners, ensuring clients receive high‑quality delivery, scalable support, and a consistent experience —
without long sales cycles or bespoke consulting engagements.

Direct engagement with financial institutions occurs only when the work is well‑defined, low‑friction, and aligned with
the standard delivery model.

## Partner Engagement Framework

Jube’s partner model begins with a single, essential foundation [training](/jube-training).  
All successful engagements originate with partner teams becoming fully Jube‑capable before client delivery or
integration work begins.  
The framework is intentionally simple, repeatable, and centred on capability building.

### ⚡ 1. Training & Enablement (The Starting Point)

Training is the entry point for every partner relationship.  
Partner teams receive structured, hands‑on instruction delivered by the developer of Jube, covering:

- behavioural modelling
- AML and fraud transaction monitoring
- rule strategy and model configuration
- operational workflows
- implementation methodology

This phase ensures partner SMEs have the competence and confidence to design, deploy, and operate Jube independently.

### 🔧 2. Integration Pilot

Once trained, partners move into a guided pilot phase to accelerate their first client engagement.  
This period provides:

- light‑touch architectural guidance
- validation of early design decisions
- answers to advanced technical and operational questions
- support in shaping a clean, successful initial implementation

Pilots remain partner‑led while benefiting from direct access to the creator of Jube.

### 📘 3. Optional Expert of Record

Ensure delivery success without taking over your team. With an optional Expert of Record engagement, Jube provides:

- Priority access to senior expertise
- Architectural guidance and best-practice reviews
- Support during high-value client projects
- SME input on rules, data flows, and operational design

You retain full control of client relationships while benefiting from expert oversight and risk reduction.

- AML / financial crime consultancies
