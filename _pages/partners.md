permalink: /partners/
---

Empower partners to deliver high‑performance AML and behavioural‑modelling solutions with confidence — starting with deep, developer‑led training that unlocks the full capability of Jube’s real‑time, open‑source platform.

---

## Partner‑First Engagement Model

**Jube operates on a partner‑first model.** The preferred and primary engagement approach is through trained implementation partners, ensuring clients receive high‑quality delivery, scalable support, and a consistent experience — without long sales cycles or bespoke consulting engagements.

Direct engagement with financial institutions occurs only when the work is well‑defined, low‑friction, and aligned with the standard delivery model.

## Partner Engagement Framework

Jube’s partner model begins with a single, essential foundation [training](/jube-training).  
All successful engagements originate with partner teams becoming fully Jube‑capable before client delivery or integration work begins.  
The framework is intentionally simple, repeatable, and centred on capability building.

### ⚡ 1. Training & Enablement (The Starting Point)
Training is the entry point for every partner relationship.  
Partner teams receive structured, hands‑on instruction delivered by the developer of Jube, covering:

- behavioural modelling
- AML and fraud transaction monitoring
- rule strategy and model configuration
- operational workflows
- implementation methodology

This phase ensures partner SMEs have the competence and confidence to design, deploy, and operate Jube independently.

### 🔧 2. Integration Pilot
Once trained, partners move into a guided pilot phase to accelerate their first client engagement.  
This period provides:

- light‑touch architectural guidance
- validation of early design decisions
- answers to advanced technical and operational questions
- support in shaping a clean, successful initial implementation

Pilots remain partner‑led while benefiting from direct access to the creator of Jube.

### 📘 3. Retained Services
For ongoing delivery, an optional retained package provides a small number of hours per month for:

- architectural oversight
- model optimisation
- support with high‑value client engagements
- SME input on rules, data flows, and operational design

This structure maintains long‑term quality without displacing the partner’s relationship with their clients.

## Ideal Partner Profiles

- AML / financial crime consultancies
- Data engineering and analytics firms
- Cloud integrators (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Fintech and RegTech development boutiques
- System integrators with established financial‑institution clients

Partnerships work best where trusted client relationships already exist.
